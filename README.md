TiDeTree
========

TiDeTree is a BEAST 2 package that enables inference of time-scaled single-cell phylogenies and population dynamic parameters such as cell division, death, and differentiation rates from genetic lineage tracing data.

For further information please check out our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.14.480422)

### TODO:
- [ ] integrate with [BEAUti](https://www.beast2.org/beauti/) to allow easy package installation
- [ ] write tutorial to be published on taming-the-beast.org
